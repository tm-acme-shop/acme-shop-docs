# A Company Manufacturing Everything (ACME) Shop

## Overview

> *"A Company Manufacturing Everything"* — Since 1949, ACME Corporation has been the trusted supplier of anvils, rocket-powered roller skates, and giant magnets to cartoon characters worldwide. Now, we're pivoting to e-commerce.

**ACME Shop** is our fictional e-commerce SaaS platform — a sprawling, realistic codebase complete with:
- 🏗️ Multi-repo, multi-language microservices architecture
- 🔧 Legacy code migrations in progress (some... more in progress than others)
- 🐛 Intentionally planted bugs, security issues, and anti-patterns
- 📜 The kind of technical debt that makes engineers weep

This demo environment showcases all Sourcegraph features through the lens of a codebase that has seen things. Things like MD5 password hashing. Things like `0.0.0.0/0` security groups. Things that keep security teams up at night.

### The Backstory

The ACME Shop engineering team is mid-migration on *everything*:
- **Auth**: Moving from MD5 → bcrypt (yes, really, MD5 was in prod)
- **APIs**: v1 → v2 migration (v1 endpoints marked deprecated but still... everywhere)
- **Logging**: printf-style → structured logging
- **Payments**: Legacy client → new client (bank transfers still use the old one 🙃)
- **Infrastructure**: "We'll fix it after launch" → actually fixing it
